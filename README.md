# Dunkest Data Analysis App

In this project I have built a Shiny application for the analysis of [Dunkest](https://dunkest.com/en) data. 

Citing its description in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dunkest-fantasy-basketball/id1073967253), "Dunkest is an excellent Fantasy Basketball based on the NBA and Euroleague championship. With Dunkest you can create a fantasy basketball team choosing real NBA and Euroleague players. According to the real stats (points, assists, rebounds, etc.), your fantasy-team will receive a score that will determine your ranking."

The data has been collected from the Dunkest webpage and these data have been stored in a CSV file. With this CSV file, a [Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/edu9as/dunkest/blob/main/Dunkest.ipynb) and an [R Shiny application](https://edu9as.shinyapps.io/dunkest/) have been written.
